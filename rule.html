                <h2>General Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Staying updated on any rule modifications on our website or Discord is your responsibility.</li>
                    <li>Playing content that is protected by copyright (DMCA) is strictly prohibited. This includes copyrighted movies, music, and other protected materials. It is essential to respect the rights of content creators and obtain appropriate permissions from the rights holders before performing scenes or using copyrighted content. Let's ensure that we maintain a lawful and respectful environment by adhering to these guidelines.</li>
                    <li>You must have a working voice microphone.</li>
                    <li>Engaging in Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is strictly prohibited within our community. This encompasses any form of explicit or sexually suggestive content, including the posting of nudity or lewd materials.</li>
                    <li>It is important to refrain from influencing or encouraging others to break the rules. Such behavior can have consequences, and you may receive a suitable punishment for your actions.</li>
                    <li>Real-life events, including suicide roleplay, terrorism threats, pandemics, and mental illnesses, are strictly prohibited within the city. We prioritize the well-being and safety of our community members and strive to provide an enjoyable and inclusive environment. We kindly request that you refrain from incorporating or depicting such sensitive topics in your roleplay.</li>
                    <li>Roleplay should consider all parties involved in the scene or situation agreed to pursue it. It is important to respect the consent and comfort of all participants. If there is a disagreement or discomfort during roleplay, it is essential to communicate openly and reach a consensus among all involved parties.</li>
                    <li>It is strictly prohibited to use slurs or offensive language on any EchoRP platforms.</li>
                    <li>We have a zero-tolerance policy towards racism, trolling, discrimination, homophobia, and sexism within our community.</li>
                    <li>Treat each other with respect, everyone is equal.</li>
                    <li>The use of derogatory terms, including but not limited to the word "retard", is strictly prohibited within our community.</li>
                    <li>Attacking or harassing individuals towards members on other Discord servers, YouTube, Twitter, or any other platform is strictly prohibited within our community. We expect all members to conduct themselves responsibly and respectfully, both within our community and in interactions with others outside of it. Any instances of attacking or harassing behavior will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action.</li>
                    <li>To ensure a healthy and inclusive environment for all members, content creators are expected to actively moderate their communities. Failure to do so, which includes neglecting to prevent members from engaging in attacks or other harmful behavior, may lead to a ban from the community. We prioritize maintaining a safe and respectful space, and your cooperation in upholding these standards is greatly appreciated.</li>

            <div id="crime">
                <h2>Crime & Gangs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum limit for engaging in a criminal activity is set at five criminals, with the exception of the Oil Rig activity, which allows for up to six participants. It's important to note that the term "criminal activities" encompasses a wide range of actions that involve breaking the law and is not limited to just robberies.</li>
                    <li>5-man rule - Establishes that criminal activities are restricted to a maximum of five players at a time. This limitation ensures that criminal scenarios remain balanced and fair, without allowing for external assistance or intervention. It means that the participants initially involved in the scenario are the only ones allowed to be present until the situation is fully resolved. This includes prohibiting additional individuals from providing information, acting as lookouts, or utilizing radio communications to influence the scenario. Furthermore, gangs are not allowed to take a scenario to their turf or near their turf if doing so would violate the 5-man rule.</li>
                    <li>During criminal activities, mechanics are prohibited from utilizing their F1 menu or any other abilities that are specific to their job.</li>
                    <li>When participating in criminal activities, separate groups are not allowed to collaborate and work together towards different objectives simultaneously. Each group must adhere to their respective timer and operate independently.</li>
                    <li>Prison transports are treated as separate scenarios from the original incident that led to the arrest. When attempting to attack a prison transport, you are allowed to assemble a new group of up to five individuals specifically for that purpose.</li>
                    <li>Fake hostages are strictly prohibited within our community. When planning and executing robberies or similar criminal activities, it is essential to adhere to the correct procedures and guidelines. This ensures a fair and immersive roleplaying experience for all participants. Creating fake hostages undermines the integrity of the roleplay and can lead to confusion and misunderstandings.</li>
                    <li>For activities such as Drug Runs, Fleeca, G6, Paleto Bank, and the Pacific Standard Vault, it is expected that participants have a well-thought-out and detailed robbery plan. Simply evading the police by driving until they lose sight of you is considered a lack of depth and creativity in executing a robbery. To enhance the roleplay experience, we encourage participants to develop creative strategies, consider different approaches, and plan their actions thoroughly. This adds excitement, depth, and immersion to the criminal activities, creating more engaging interactions for all involved.</li>
                    <li>After engaging in store robberies or car boosts, it is necessary to impose a self-cooldown period of 45 minutes. Similarly, for Vangelico robberies, the cooldown is 90 minutes, Fleeca Robberies, Bank Trucks and Drug Runs require a cooldown of 120 minutes. G6, Paleto Bank, and Pacific Standard heists have a cooldown of 180 minutes. It's important to note that these cooldowns apply collectively rather than individually. This means that if you participate in a Fleeca Bank robbery, for instance, you must wait for the full cooldown period before engaging in any other robbery mentioned previously.</li>
                    <li>Robbing other players is permitted, but must be executed with high-quality roleplay, including a justified context/reason for targeting the individual(s). We encourage you to use appropriate commands, like /me takes cash from pockets, to enrich the scene. There's no cap on the amount taken, but focus on the roleplay quality, not the loot.</li>
                    <li>Scamming within our community must be carried out through in-game roleplay interactions. It is necessary to have a valid roleplay reason and an expectation of continued roleplay before engaging in any scamming activities. Scamming solely for profit or to cause conflict without a legitimate roleplay basis is not considered acceptable.</li>
                    <li>Engaging in scams that involve accessing unauthorized menus or teleporting, with the exception of the F2 inventory menu, is strictly prohibited within our community.</li>
                    <li>Using server functions or mechanics to gain an unfair advantage in a scam is strictly prohibited. It is not permissible to exploit or rely on any server functions that are not working properly in order to execute a scam.</li>
                    <li>Any place with a "teleport" are places you are prohibited to rob players.</li>
                    <li>Interfering with ongoing robberies that have an active police presence is strictly prohibited within our community, unless specific circumstances apply. For example, if a player or group is conducting a Pacific Standard heist, others are not allowed to enter the bank without permission from the party involved. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Gangs are permitted to interfere with store robberies if the establishment being robbed falls within their turf. Additionally, store owners have the right to intervene if the store they own is being robbed.</li>
                </ul>

            <div id="roleplay">
                <h2>Roleplay Rules</h2>

                <h3>Deathmatch, Revenge Killing & Kill On Sight</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Before engaging in a shootout or any form of violent confrontation, it is essential to initiate roleplay (RP) interactions with the involved parties. This means that players should verbally communicate their intentions, establish the context of the conflict, and allow for an immersive roleplaying experience to unfold. By initiating RP before a shootout, we promote meaningful interactions, character development, and a more engaging roleplaying environment.</li>
                    <li>You are permitted to initiate an attack or defend yourself if another player intentionally tries to harm you, damage your property, ignores your threats and attempts to resist, or takes hostile action against you.</li>
                    <li>Random Deathmatch (RDM) is strictly prohibited within our community. RDM refers to the act of intentionally killing or hurting another player, or damaging their property, without a valid in-character reason or proper roleplay justification.</li>
                    <li>Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM) is strictly prohibited within our community. VDM refers to the act of intentionally killing or hurting another player, or damaging their property, by using a vehicle without a valid in-character reason or proper roleplay justification. We emphasize the importance of responsible and immersive roleplay experiences, where actions involving vehicles align with the logical context of the situation. It's crucial to avoid using vehicles as weapons to harm others without valid in-character justifications. Additionally, intentionally running over another individual, even with a valid in-character reason, may still be considered Low-Quality Roleplay (LQRP) and should be avoided.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>New Life Rule (NLR)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>New Life Rule: Triggered once you are incapacitated and respawn or are treated at the hospital, the cause of incapacitation is irrelevant.</li>
                    <li>Once a player becomes incapacitated, they cannot come back to the area of their death for 30 minutes and they cannot take hostile action against the party responsible for their death for 60 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If you are downed in a scenario and it has ended, you are not allowed to return to the area of the scene to collect evidence, loot bodies, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Combat & Roleplay Logging</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players are not permitted to disconnect or respawn from a roleplay or combat situation that could have in-character consequences. This rule ensures continuity and fairness within ongoing scenarios by discouraging abrupt disconnections or respawning to avoid in-character repercussions.</li>
                    <li>In the event of a game crash or disconnection, it is expected that players make an effort to reconnect to the server as soon as possible and resume their roleplaying scenario.</li>
                    <li>During combat situations, it is not permissible to use emotes (such as passout, sleep, etc.) to gain an unfair advantage.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="metagaming">
                <h2>Metagaming, Powergaming & Torture RP</h2>
                <p>Metagaming: Refers to the use of real-life information that is obtained outside the game to gain an unfair advantage in-character. This includes instances where a player uses external sources, such as streams or name tags, to acquire information about another player's location or identity, which their character would not realistically possess. Metagaming undermines the immersive and roleplaying nature of the game, as it blurs the line between in-game knowledge and real-life information.</p>
                <p>Engaging in metagaming to gain an in-game advantage, such as seeking assistance from allies through out-of-character channels, is considered a more serious offense than accidental metagaming that has no tangible benefit to the player, such as mistakenly addressing a stranger by their character name. Accidental metagaming, while still discouraged, may occur unintentionally and without malicious intent. However, intentional metagaming to gain an unfair advantage disrupts the roleplaying experience and undermines the integrity of the game. Such actions compromise the fairness and immersion for other players, and therefore, stricter punishments are usually imposed to deter this behavior.</p>
                <p>While in the city, you are not permitted to appear in livestreams (eg. Discord, Twitch, Facebook Gaming, YouTube) of other players who are also in the city.</p>
                <p>Powergaming refers to the act of roleplaying with mechanics or abilities that do not exist within the game or forcing other players into situations where they have limited or no choices. This behavior disrupts the immersive and collaborative nature of roleplaying by disregarding the boundaries and limitations established within the game world. It is important to prioritize realistic and engaging roleplay interactions that align with the available mechanics and abilities within the game.</p>
                <p>Having a non-felon sell honey to avoid the reward penalty a felon would normally receive is considered powergaming.</p>
                <p>Using the /me command in a way that forces roleplay outcomes in your favor, rather than leaving it open-ended for all parties involved, is considered a form of powergaming and is discouraged.</p>
                <p>Spam jumping to speed up the movement of your character is a form of powergaming.</p>
                <p>Putting a stash or other furniture outside the shell of a player owned property, so it is not visible to the naked eye, is not allowed.</p>
                <p>Unnecessarily escorting, cuffing, or carrying someone with the intention of gaining an advantage over a player who is not in a downed state is strictly prohibited.</p>
                <p>Using a vehicle to flip over another vehicle is considered powergaming.</p>
                <p>You must never spam the attacking/melee button on someone.</p>
                <p>Intentionally dragging a player around with the purpose of avoiding roleplay or causing annoyance is considered a serious offense and can result in a ban.</p>
                <p>Torture roleplay, if consented to by all parties involved, must adhere to certain guidelines. Before engaging in torture roleplay, it is essential to obtain explicit consent from the other party through a /me command to ensure they are comfortable with the actions being inflicted upon their character. If, during the roleplay, the player being tortured responds with a statement indicating discomfort or their objection to the situation (eg. /me Not ok with that), the scenario must be promptly concluded without further pursuing or escalating the torture roleplay.</p>
                <p>Vehicles with unbreakable windows, extremely small windows, covered fronts, or those that provide an unfair advantage in shootouts are strictly prohibited from being used for criminal activities.</p>
                <p>Use of third party VOIP (Skype, Discord, Zoom, Teamspeak, etc.) is strictly prohibited while connected to the server.</p>
                <p>Under no circumstances is a criminal allowed to force a victim to sell their property, including houses, vehicles, or businesses.</p>
                <p>Demanding someone to withdraw money from their bank account via an ATM, bank, or phone is strictly prohibited.</p>
                <p>Forcing someone to use a crafting or buy station is considered a form of powergaming and is not allowed.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="roleplay-quality">
                <h2>Roleplay Quality</h2>

                <h3>Cop baiting</h3>
                <p>Cop baiting, intentionally provoking or luring police officers into scenarios without proper roleplay behind it, is considered a form of low-quality roleplay within the EchoRP community. Engaging in cop baiting, such as deliberately causing a collision with a cop car to initiate a chase for the sole purpose of a gunfight or ambush, undermines the immersive and realistic roleplay experience.</p>

                <h3>Money simulator gameplay</h3>
                <p>Please avoid engaging in money simulator gameplay, which refers to prioritizing monetary gains over meaningful interactions with other individuals within the EchoRP community. This type of gameplay focuses solely on accumulating wealth without considering the importance of social engagement and roleplay interactions. Let's emphasize the value of engaging with others, building relationships, and creating dynamic and immersive roleplay experiences that go beyond monetary pursuits.</p>

                <h3>EMS interactions</h3>
                <p>Refusing to respond or cooperate with EMS staff members may lead to consequences, including a possible kick from the server. It is crucial to prioritize roleplaying realistic and immersive scenarios, which includes engaging with EMS staff when necessary. By acknowledging and following the guidelines provided in the linked document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s/ptrNFOnhOTY/SunmooOu6fpza@mBBNk9GAQSvoWUo/edit), we ensure a cohesive and enjoyable roleplay experience for all community members.</p>

                <h3>Salty and toxic behavior</h3>
                <p>We have a strict policy against engaging in salty and toxic behavior within the EchoRP community. This includes actions such as repeatedly shooting a downed body, playing loud or disruptive music, screaming excessively over the microphone, spitting on or emoting disrespectfully towards downed bodies, engaging in disruptive spinning, and involving oneself in unnecessary Twitter drama.</p>

                <h3>Hospital camping</h3>
                <p>Hospital camping, which refers to intentionally waiting or lingering near a hospital to taunt or provoke players who have recently lost a fight, is not permitted.</p>

                <h3>Scenes in EchoRP</h3>
                <p>Scenes in EchoRP should be utilized to enhance roleplay by providing context and atmosphere.</p>

                <h3>Interactions with police officers</h3>
                <p>During interactions with police officers, it is essential for criminals to provide a valid and proper reasoning during initiation before resorting to shooting. This includes situations where there may be heightened tensions or increased conflicts, such as during mag dump season.</p>

                <h3>Randomly blowing up vehicles</h3>
                <p>Randomly blowing up vehicles without proper initiation is strictly prohibited within EchoRP.</p>

                <h3>Fail/Low Quality Roleplay (LQRP, FRP)</h3>
                <p>FailRP, also known as Low Quality RP, refers to actions that are unrealistic or detrimental to the roleplay experience of other players. It is important to note that not all actions that may seem unrealistic will be considered punishable, as some degree of creative freedom is encouraged in roleplay. However, actions that significantly disrupt the immersion, coherence, or enjoyment of other players may be subject to consequences.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: Taking a vehicle and stripping the upgrades off of it.</li>
                    <li>Example: Failing to respond to /me interactions of other players, such as /me takes off mask or /me steals shoes.</li>
                    <li>Example: Talking normally after you have gunshot wounds. To avoid salt, attempt to RP your injuries out by screaming rather than engaging in conversation with the other party. This includes giving communications while down.</li>
                    <li>Example: Using a tazer to pop a tire of a vehicle.</li>
                    <li>Example: Spectating shootouts.</li>
                    <li>Example: Robbing someone without reason or sufficient roleplay (inc. cops).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Value of Life</h3>
                <p>Value of Life: Players must prioritize their character's life and act as if they have only one life. This means taking realistic precautions and avoiding situations that would knowingly put their character's life at unnecessary risk.</p>
                <p>If you find yourself in a situation where you are at a clear disadvantage, such as having a gun pointed at the back of your head while you are unaware, it is expected that you comply with the demands of the other party.</p>
                <p>In situations where you are outnumbered by a significant margin, such as being outnumbered 3 to 1, it is generally expected that you comply with the group's demands. However, it is important to note that this does not eliminate your option to try and escape if the situation allows for it. While attempting to escape may be a viable option in certain circumstances, it should be done in a realistic manner.</p>
                <p>A bad example of an attempt to escape would be if you are being held hostage in front of a bank and, despite the person holding a firearm ready to use, you suddenly decide to run away without any reasonable chance of success.</p>

                <h3>Economy Rules</h3>
                <p>Creating new characters with the purpose of transferring starter money or assets to another character is strictly prohibited within our community. Any individuals found engaging in such activities will face consequences, including the revocation of all money involved and subsequent bans. Additionally, transferring accumulated assets from one character to another, regardless of the reason, is also not allowed. We enforce these rules to ensure fairness and maintain a balanced economy within our community.</p>
                <p>Asset (not limited to vehicles) limitations enforced by the LSRS application must never be bypassed and selling outside of the script in place is considered exploiting.</p>
                <p>Example: Travis purchased an import for $360k. He is now selling it to Taylor at an agreed price of $1,000,000. Taylor sends Travis a $640,000 direct transfer and then accepts the sale through the app for the remaining amount that the script allows for. In doing so, the buyer has lower asset fees despite buying the car for a higher amount.</p>

                <h3>Aircraft Rules</h3>
                <p>The use of aircraft is considered a privilege and must be handled with care. Any unrealistic or low-quality use of aircraft, such as intentionally colliding with other helicopters, is strictly prohibited.</p>
                <p>Aircraft should not be used as a means to easily evade police capture.</p>
                <p>Using aircraft to rapidly deploy or "hot drop" into gang conflicts, wars, or similar scenarios is not allowed, unless trained to do so (eg. as a cop).</p>
                <p>Aircraft should be used for legitimate purposes such as reconnaissance, transportation to and from the island, or other non-violent activities.</p>
